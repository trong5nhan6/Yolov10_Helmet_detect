## Introduction

This project utilizes the YOLOv10 model to detect helmets in images and videos. YOLOv10 (You Only Look Once, version 10) is a state-of-the-art object detection model that provides high accuracy and speed. This project aims to enhance safety by ensuring that helmets are worn in environments where they are required.

## Features

-   High accuracy helmet detection using YOLOv10.
-   Real-time processing for video streams.
-   Easy integration with existing applications.

## System Requirements

-   Python 3.7 or later
-   CUDA-compatible GPU (optional but recommended for faster processing)
-   Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
```c
git clone https://github.com/trong5nhan6/Yolov10_Helmet_detect.git
cd Yolov10_Helmet_detect`
```
2.  **Run project**
- Run file Yolov10_Helmet_detect.ipynb
